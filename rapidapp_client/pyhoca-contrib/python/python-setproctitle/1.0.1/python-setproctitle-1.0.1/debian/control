Description: A setproctitle implementation for Python
 The library allows a process to change its title (as displayed by system tools
 such as ps and top).
 .
 Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example when
 a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows to identify
 the task each process is busy with. The technique is used by PostgreSQL and
 the OpenSSH Server for example.
